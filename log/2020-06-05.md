# Digital Ocean credits expired

Effective immediately, I have terminated the matterbridge droplet due to Digital Ocean
expiring the remaining credit I was initially given. I will be looking to migrate to
a different hosting provider, but in the mean time the mako-bot will be suspended.

Lucas Ramage
