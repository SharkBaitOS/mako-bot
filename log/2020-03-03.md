# Discovering that the mako-bot repository has been removed from GitHub

While investigating that matterbridge had been stopped due to a forced reboot by Digital Ocean,
I noticed that the repository for mako-bot had been removed from GitHub.

Some of the integrations I am using for the matterbridge configuration, **require GitHub**;
therefore, even though we have transitioned over to GitLab, this repository and the sharkbait-bot
account must continue to reside here on GitHub for the foreseeable future.

Regards,
Lucas Ramage
