# Discovering that the mako-bot repository had been removed from GitHub

While investigating that matterbridge had been stopped due to a [forced reboot by Digital Ocean](2020-02-22.md),
I noticed that the [repository for mako-bot][mako-bot-repo] had been removed from GitHub.

Some of the integrations I am using for the [matterbridge configuration](../matterbridge.toml.gpg), **require GitHub**;
therefore, even though we have transitioned over to [GitLab](https://gitlab.com/sharkbaitos), [this repository][mako-bot-repo] and the [sharkbait-bot account](https://github.com/sharkbait-bot) must continue to reside here on GitHub for the foreseeable future.

Regards,
Lucas Ramage
